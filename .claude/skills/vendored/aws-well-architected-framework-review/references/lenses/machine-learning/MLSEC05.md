# MLSEC05-BP01 Protect against adversarial and malicious activities

Machine learning systems must be robust against adversarial inputs
designed to manipulate their behavior. Implementing protection
mechanisms both inside and outside of your deployed models can
detect malicious inputs that could lead to incorrect predictions,
allowing you to automatically identify unauthorized changes, repair
compromised inputs, and validate data before it's used for further
training.

**Desired outcome:** You can detect,
mitigate, and protect your ML models from adversarial exploits that
attempt to manipulate inputs, preserving model integrity and
providing reliable predictions. Your ML systems incorporate robust
validation processes, ensemble approaches, and monitoring
capabilities that maintain consistent performance even when faced
with deliberately perturbed or malicious inputs.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Implementing ML models without considering potential adversarial
threats.
- Focusing solely on model performance metrics without evaluating
robustness.
- Using single model architectures that are vulnerable to targeted
threats.
- Retraining models with unvalidated inputs that may contain
adversarial examples.
- Exposing ML models through unsecured endpoints without
monitoring capabilities.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Improved model robustness against input manipulation attempts.
- Enhanced detection of potential security threats targeting ML
systems.
- Greater reliability in model predictions even under adversarial
conditions.
- Protection against data poisoning during model retraining.
- Reduced vulnerability to model extraction and inference threats.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Adversarial threats against machine learning models involve
deliberately crafting inputs to cause incorrect predictions or
undesirable behaviors. These threats can range from subtle
perturbations that are imperceptible to humans but cause model
errors, to more sophisticated techniques that exploit model
vulnerabilities. Building protection against adversarial
activities requires a multi-layered approach combining robust
model design, comprehensive monitoring, and secure deployment
strategies.

When implementing defenses, you need to understand the specific
vulnerabilities in your models and the potential impact of
adversarial threats on your business outcomes. This requires
conducting thorough evaluations of model behavior under different
threats scenarios and implementing appropriate countermeasures
based on your risk profile. Both pre-deployment testing and
continuous monitoring during production are essential components
of a comprehensive protection strategy.

Adversarial robustness should be considered from the beginning of
your ML development process rather than as an afterthought. By
incorporating adversarial training, ensemble methods, and input
validation techniques during model development, you can create
systems that are inherently more resistant to threats.
Additionally, implementing proper access controls, monitoring
systems, and incident response procedures can establish a secure
operational environment for your ML models.

### Implementation steps

- **Evaluate the robustness of your
algorithm**. Conduct sensitivity analysis to
understand how your model responds to perturbed inputs. Test
your model with increasingly modified data points to
identify decision boundaries that might be vulnerable to
manipulation. Use adversarial testing frameworks to simulate
potential threats and measure their impact on model
performance. Document the types of perturbations that cause
incorrect predictions to inform your defense strategy.
- **Build for robustness from the
start**. Select diverse features during model
design to improve resilience against outliers and
adversarial examples. Implement ensemble methods by
combining multiple models with different architectures or
training approaches to increase decision diversity. Consider
techniques like adversarial training where you intentionally
incorporate adversarial examples into your training data to
make your models more resistant to threats.
- **Identify repeats and suspicious
patterns**. Deploy
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/model-monitor/) to continuously analyze
inference data and detect unusual patterns such as repeated
similar inputs that may indicate probing threats. Set up
alerts for anomalous input distributions that differ from
training data. Monitor for evidence of model brute-forcing,
where bad actors systematically vary limited sets of input
features to determine decision boundaries and derive feature
importance.
- **Implement experiment and model
tracking**. Maintain comprehensive records of data
provenance and model versions to trace model skew back to
potentially compromised data sources. Before retraining
models with new data, implement validation processes to
identify and remove adversarial examples. Use
[Amazon SageMaker AI MLflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/mlflow.html) to document relationships between
datasets, algorithms, and model artifacts throughout the ML
lifecycle.
- **Use secure inference API
endpoints**. Host models behind properly secured
API endpoints that implement authentication, authorization,
and input validation. Configure
[Amazon SageMaker AI endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-manage.html) with appropriate security
controls including VPC isolation,
[AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) roles with least privilege, and encryption for
data in transit and at rest. Implement rate limiting and
request validation to block abuse of model APIs. Monitor API
usage patterns to detect potential exploitation attempts.
- **Implement continuous model
monitoring**. Set up
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/model-monitor/) to track data and concept
drift that may indicate adversarial manipulation. Configure
automatic alerts when inference data patterns deviate from
training baselines. Periodically reevaluate model robustness
as new threat techniques emerge in the security landscape.
- **Establish incident response
procedures**. Develop clear protocols for
responding to detected adversarial threats against your ML
systems. Define procedures for model rollback, data
quarantine, and forensic analysis when suspicious activities
are identified. Document lessons learned from security
incidents to continuously improve protection strategies.
- **Apply input validation
guardrails**. For AI models, implement robust input
validation and filtering mechanisms to block injection
exploits. Implement custom guardrails to protect against
harmful inputs that may manipulate model behavior. Monitor
input patterns and responses to detect attempts to bypass
security controls.
