# MLCOST03-BP01 Use managed data labeling

Use managed labeling tools that provide automation and access to
cost-effective teams of human data labelers. These tools should
offer flexibility to choose a variable number of labelers for each
input, include a user-friendly interface, and incorporate learning
capabilities to improve labeling efficiency over time.

**Desired outcome:** You have access
to high-quality labeled datasets for your machine learning models
without building and managing your own labeling infrastructure. Your
data labeling process is streamlined, cost-efficient, and scales
according to your needs, allowing you to focus on model development
rather than data preparation logistics.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Building custom data labeling infrastructure from scratch.
- Relying solely on in-house teams for labeling tasks regardless
of scale.
- Using labeling solutions that don't improve through machine
learning.
- Managing inconsistent labeling quality without proper oversight
tools.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduce time-to-market for ML models by accelerating the data
labeling process.
- Lower total labeling costs through efficient automation and
on-demand workforce.
- Improve labeling quality and consistency through specialized
tools and workflows.
- Scale labeling operations up or down based on project
requirements.
- Focus your team's effort on model development rather than
labeling infrastructure.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To build effective machine learning models, you need large,
high-quality labeled datasets. Creating these datasets manually is
time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to scale. By using
managed data labeling services, you can accelerate this critical
step in the ML development process while controlling costs and
maintaining quality.

Managed data labeling combines human intelligence with machine
learning to improve efficiency over time. As your models process
more data, they can begin to automate parts of the labeling
process, reducing costs and time required. These services also
provide quality control mechanisms through consensus models, where
multiple labelers evaluate the same data to check accuracy.

When selecting a managed data labeling solution, consider factors
like the types of data you need to label (like images, text, and
video), the complexity of your labeling tasks, integration with
your existing ML workflow, and cost structure. The right solution
will scale with your needs and provide consistent, high-quality
labeled data.

### Implementation steps

- **Assess your data labeling
requirements**. Define what types of data you need
labeled (images, text, audio, or video), the complexity of
annotations required, expected volume, and quality
standards. Determine whether you need specialized domain
expertise for your labeling tasks.
- **Use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth**. To train a machine learning model, you
need a large, high-quality, labeled dataset.
[Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms.html) assists you to build
high-quality training datasets for your ML models. With
Ground Truth, you can use ML along with workers from a
vendor company that you choose, or an internal, private
workforce to create a labeled dataset. You can use the
labeled dataset output from Ground Truth to train your own
models. You can also use the output as a training data set
for an Amazon SageMaker AI model.
- **Use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
Plus**. Ground Truth Plus is a turn-key service
that uses an expert workforce to deliver high-quality
training datasets fast, and reduces costs by up to 40
percent.
[Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gtp.html) enables you to create
high-quality training datasets without having to build
labeling applications and manage the labeling workforce on
your own. By using this approach, you don't need to have
deep ML expertise or extensive knowledge of workflow design
and quality management. You simply provide data along with
labeling requirements and Ground Truth Plus sets up the data
labeling workflows and manages them on your behalf in
accordance with your requirements.
- **Configure active learning
workflows**. Set up your labeling projects to use
active learning, where the system learns from human
annotations and begins to automate labeling for similar
items. This reduces the number of items requiring manual
labeling over time, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth provides built-in support for
active learning.
- **Implement quality control
mechanisms**. Configure your labeling jobs to use
multiple workers per data item and determine consensus
approaches based on your quality requirements. Monitor
labeling performance and adjust your quality control
parameters as needed.
- **Set up real-time data labeling
pipelines**. For ongoing ML projects, establish
continuous data labeling pipelines that can process new data
as it becomes available. This way, your models can be
regularly retrained with fresh data.
- **Create custom labeling interfaces
when needed**. For specialized labeling tasks, use
Ground Truth's custom template capabilities to create
tailored labeling interfaces that make the process more
efficient for your specific use case.
- **Use enhanced Ground Truth
capabilities**. Use improved Ground Truth Plus
features that provide up to 40% cost reduction through
expert workforce management and automated quality control
mechanisms.
- **Use foundation models for
pre-labeling**. Use generative AI models through
Amazon Bedrock to assist with initial data labeling, which
can then be verified by human labelers. This hybrid approach
can significantly accelerate the labeling process while
maintaining quality control.

# MLCOST03-BP04 Enable feature reusability

Reduce duplication and the rerunning of feature engineering code
across teams and projects by using feature storage. The store should
have online and offline storage, and data encryption capabilities.
An online store with low-latency retrieval capabilities is ideal for
real-time inference. An offline store maintains a history of feature
values and is suited for training and batch scoring.

**Desired outcome:** You gain a
centralized repository for storing, sharing, and managing machine
learning features that reduces redundant work across teams and
projects. You access features with low latency for real-time
applications while maintaining a historical record for training
purposes. Your feature store integrates seamlessly with your ML
workflows, enhancing collaboration and accelerating model
development while maintaining data security through robust
encryption.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Recreating the same features repeatedly across different teams
and projects.
- Storing features in isolated data silos that avoid reuse.
- Lacking version control for features, leading to inconsistencies
between training and inference.
- Using separate systems for real-time and batch feature access.
- Implementing homegrown feature storage solutions that lack
scalability and proper governance.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Reduces redundant work and computational costs.
- Creates consistency between training and inference environments.
- Enables collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams.
- Provides feature governance, lineage, and traceability.
- Reduces time to production for ML models.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Feature engineering is often one of the most time-consuming
aspects of machine learning development. When teams work in silos,
they frequently recreate the same features, wasting valuable time
and resources. By implementing a centralized feature store, you
create a single source of truth for ML features that promotes
reusability across your organization.

A well-designed feature store addresses the dual requirements of
offline storage for training and batch inference and online
storage for low-latency real-time inference. This dual-storage
paradigm creates consistency between training and serving
environments while optimizing for different access patterns. The
feature store should also provide capabilities for feature
versioning, access control, and monitoring to maintain data
quality and governance.

Amazon SageMaker AI Feature Store offers these capabilities as a
fully managed service, which reduces the need to build and
maintain complex infrastructure. It seamlessly integrates with
your ML pipelines and supports both batch and real-time inference
workflows, making it an ideal solution for feature reusability.

### Implementation steps

- **Identify common features across
projects**. Begin by analyzing your existing ML
workflows to identify frequently used features that would
benefit from centralization. Look for redundancies in
feature engineering code across different teams and
prioritize these for migration to the feature store.
- **Set up Amazon SageMaker AI Feature
Store**. Create feature groups in
[Amazon SageMaker AI Feature Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store.html) to organize related
features. Define the schema for each feature group,
including feature names, data types, and primary keys.
Consider the access patterns for both training and inference
when designing your feature groups.
- **Configure storage options based on
requirements**. Determine whether each feature
group needs online storage, offline storage, or both.
Configure the appropriate storage options:

**Online store:** Set up
for low-latency access (milliseconds) needed for
real-time inference
- **Offline store:**
Configure Amazon S3 storage for training and batch
inference workloads
- **Online and offline:**
Implement both for maximum flexibility

- **Implement data ingestion
pipelines**. Develop automated pipelines to ingest
data into your feature store. You can use
[Amazon SageMaker AI Data Wrangler](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/data-wrangler/) for data preparation and
[Amazon SageMaker AI Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/) for orchestration.
- **Establish feature access
patterns**. Create standardized methods for
retrieving features for both training and inference. For
training, use the offline store with Amazon Athena queries
to efficiently access historical data. For real-time
inference, implement API calls to the online store for
low-latency feature retrieval.
- **Enable cross-account and cross-team
sharing**. Configure resource policies to enable
feature sharing across different teams and AWS accounts.
This promotes collaboration and maximizes feature reuse
across your organization while maintaining appropriate
access controls.
- **Implement feature versioning and
lineage tracking**. Track changes to features over
time using versioning capabilities. Link features to models
through
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry.html) to maintain full lineage
tracking from data source to deployed model.
- **Monitor feature usage and
drift**. Implement monitoring for your feature
store to detect data drift and track feature usage patterns.
Use
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) to detect changes in feature
distributions that might impact model performance.
- **Create documentation and discovery
mechanisms**. Document features and their intended
use cases to facilitate discovery and reuse. Implement
tagging and search capabilities so that data scientists can
find relevant features for their projects.
- **Use enhanced Feature Store
capabilities**. Use improved SageMaker AI Feature
Store with better performance, enhanced monitoring
capabilities, and improved integration with other SageMaker AI
services for more efficient feature management.
- **Use generative AI for feature
discovery and documentation**. Use large language
models through
[Amazon
Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to automatically generate feature
descriptions, identify potential feature relationships, and
improve feature discoverability through natural language
search capabilities.
