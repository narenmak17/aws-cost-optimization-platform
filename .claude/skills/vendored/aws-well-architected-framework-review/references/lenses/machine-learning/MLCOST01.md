# MLCOST01-BP01 Define overall return on investment (ROI) and opportunity cost

Machine learning projects require careful evaluation of their
business value and resource requirements. By analyzing the ROI and
opportunity costs of ML implementations, you can make informed
decisions that optimize resource allocation while delivering maximum
business impact.

**Desired outcome:** When you
implement this practice, you have a clear understanding of the
financial and business implications of your ML projects. You can
differentiate between research-oriented and development-oriented ML
initiatives, track costs effectively through tagging mechanisms, and
make data-driven decisions about resource allocation. You have
established processes to continuously evaluate the cost-benefit
ratio of ML initiatives as business conditions evolve, and your
investments deliver measurable value while managing risks
appropriately.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Initiating ML projects without defining clear business
objectives or expected outcomes.
- Failing to distinguish between research projects (long-term
returns) and development projects (near-term returns).
- Not implementing cost tracking mechanisms for ML projects.
- Overlooking the ongoing operational costs of maintaining ML
models in production.
- Failing to reassess the cost-benefit model when business
conditions change.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Improved allocation of limited resources to ML initiatives with
highest potential returns.
- Clear visibility into project costs and benefits for better
budgeting and planning.
- Reduced risk of project failure through upfront analysis and
ongoing monitoring.
- Enhanced ability to communicate ML value to stakeholders.
- Accelerated time-to-value through focus on high-impact use
cases.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Understanding the financial implications of machine learning
initiatives is crucial for making strategic technology
investments. Machine learning projects can vary significantly in
terms of resource requirements, timeline to value, and overall
business impact. By carefully evaluating the ROI and opportunity
costs, you can prioritize initiatives that deliver the most
significant business value while managing costs effectively.

Start by working with both technical and business teams to clearly
define whether an ML project is research-oriented (focused on
exploring potential future value) or development-oriented
(applying established methods to deliver immediate business
value). This distinction assists to set appropriate expectations
around timelines, resources, and outcomes. Implement comprehensive
cost tracking through tagging mechanisms to maintain visibility
into project expenses across data engineering, model development,
and production deployment phases.

When assessing ML project costs, consider both direct expenses
(infrastructure, tools, services) and indirect costs (staff time,
training requirements, maintenance). Factor in potential costs
associated with data preparation, model accuracy, and production
errors. Develop a comprehensive cost-benefit model that accounts
for these elements while considering business-specific factors
like competitive advantage and strategic positioning.

### Implementation steps

- **Specify the objectives of the ML
project as research or development**. Work with
both business stakeholders and data science teams to
determine if your ML initiative is exploratory research with
long-term returns or development applying established
methods for faster ROI. Align between technical teams and
business leaders on project classification, timelines, and
expected outcomes.
- **Use tagging to track costs by
project and business unit**. Implement
comprehensive tagging in your AWS environment using
[AWS Cost Categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-categories.html) and
[AWS Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) strategies to allocate ML-related expenses to
specific projects and business functions. Monitor these
costs through
[AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to maintain clear visibility of ROI by
project.
- **Evaluate and assess the data
pipeline, the ML model, and the expected quality of
production inferences**. Analyze the infrastructure
requirements, operational costs, and potential business
impact of errors in your ML system. Use
[Amazon SageMaker AI Clarify](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/) to assess model quality and
identify potential bias that could impact business outcomes
and add remediation costs.
- **Develop a cost-benefit
model**. Create a comprehensive financial model
that accounts for initial development costs, ongoing
operational expenses, and expected business benefits.
Regularly reassess this model as business conditions change
or when considering new data sources. Use
[Quick](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) to build dashboards tracking ML costs
against business KPIs.
- **Understand, evaluate, and monitor
project risks**. Identify technical, operational,
and business risks associated with your ML project.
Establish monitoring systems to track these risks through
development and production phases. Use
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to monitor technical metrics and
[AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) to track spending against forecasts.
- **Estimate the cost of resources
needed for production maintenance**. Calculate the
ongoing expenses required to maintain your ML model in
production, including data engineers, data scientists,
infrastructure costs, and monitoring systems. Consider using
[AWS Application Cost Profiler](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-application-cost-profiler/) to attribute costs
accurately across your ML applications.
- **Leverage enhanced cost tracking and
optimization tools**. Use
[AWS Cost Anomaly Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/getting-started-ad.html) to automatically identify
unusual spending patterns in your ML workloads and receive
alerts for unexpected cost increases.
- **Consider model selection trade-offs
for generative AI projects**. When implementing
generative AI solutions, carefully evaluate the balance
between model size, performance, and cost. Smaller,
domain-specific models may be more cost-effective than large
foundation models for certain use cases. Consider using
[Amazon
Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for access to multiple foundation models
through a single API, allowing for streamlined model
selection and optimization.
