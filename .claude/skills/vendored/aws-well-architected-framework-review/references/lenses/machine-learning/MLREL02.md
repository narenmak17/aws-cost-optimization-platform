# MLREL02-BP01 Use a data catalog

Process data across multiple data stores using data catalog
technology. An advanced data catalog service can enable ETL process
integration. This approach improves reliability and efficiency.

**Desired outcome:** You establish a
centralized system that inventories your ML data assets across the
organization. You can track, discover, and manage data
transformations, and your stakeholders can find and use appropriate
datasets. With a complete data catalog in place, you gain better
data governance, reduce duplication of effort, increase data
quality, and accelerate ML model development through streamlined
data preparation workflows.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Maintaining separate, isolated data silos without centralized
metadata.
- Manual tracking of data assets using spreadsheets or wiki pages.
- Failing to document data transformations and lineage.
- Rebuilding ETL processes for each new ML project.
- Relying on tribal knowledge for understanding data
characteristics.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Provides centralized visibility of available data assets.
- Improves data governance.
- Reduces time spent searching for and understanding data.
- Enhances data quality through consistent transformation
processes.
- Strengthens collaboration between data engineers and data
scientists.
- Accelerates ML model development with faster data preparation.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

A data catalog is critical infrastructure for machine learning
workloads to succeed. Without proper cataloging, data scientists
spend excessive time searching for, understanding, and preparing
data rather than analyzing it or building models. A comprehensive
data catalog provides a centralized inventory of your data assets,
complete with metadata, transformation history, and usage
information.

When implementing a data catalog for ML workloads, focus on
creating a single source of truth for data discovery. The catalog
should document where data resides, what transformations have been
applied, and how it can be accessed. This reduces the time spent
on data preparation, which typically consumes 60-80% of a data
scientist's time.

For AWS environments, the AWS AWS Glue Data Catalog offers a powerful
solution as it integrates seamlessly with other AWS analytics and
machine learning services. By implementing a data catalog as part
of your ML infrastructure, you create a foundation for consistent,
reliable data processing that supports both current and future ML
initiatives.

### Implementation steps

- **Set up AWS AWS Glue Data Catalog**. Establish the
[AWSAWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html) as your central metadata
repository. This fully managed service provides a unified
view of your data across multiple data stores, making it
accessible to various AWS services like
[Amazon SageMaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/),
[Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/),
[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), and
[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).
- **Define your metadata
strategy**. Determine what metadata to capture
about each dataset, including business definitions, data
lineage, quality metrics, and usage patterns.
Well-documented metadata assists data scientists in quickly
understanding if a dataset is appropriate for their modeling
needs.
- **Populate the data
catalog**. Use
[AWS Glue crawlers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html) to automatically discover schemas, data
types, and statistics from your data sources. Crawlers can
scan various data stores including Amazon S3, Amazon RDS,
and other database systems. Systematically add your data
sources to build comprehensive coverage.
- **Implement ETL processes with AWS Glue**. Create ETL jobs that transform raw data
into formats optimized for machine learning.
[AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) can automatically generate Python or Scala code
for these transformations, reducing development time and
improving consistency across different data processing
pipelines.
- **Establish data lineage
tracking**. Configure your data catalog to track
transformations and maintain clear lineage information. With
data lineage tracking, data scientists can understand data
provenance, which builds trust in the datasets used for
model training.
- **Integrate with ML
workflows**. Connect your AWS AWS Glue Data Catalog
with Amazon SageMaker AI to streamline data access for model
training. For enterprise environments, implement
[Amazon SageMaker AI Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-templates-sm.html) as a central metadata hub for ML
and data assets, enabling secure sharing and governed access
via Amazon DataZone integration. This integration allows
data scientists to discover and use properly prepared
datasets directly from their modeling environments.
- **Implement access controls and
governance**. Configure appropriate permissions for
your data catalog using
[AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) roles. Verify that data scientists have access to
the metadata and datasets they need while maintaining
security and regulatory adherence.
- **Automate catalog
maintenance**. Set up automated processes to keep
your data catalog current as new data arrives and
transformations occur. Regular updates verify that data
scientists have access to the latest information about
available datasets.
- **Monitor and measure
impact**. Track key metrics like time saved in data
discovery, reduction in redundant data preparation work, and
improvements in model development cycles to quantify the
benefits of your data catalog implementation.

# MLREL02-BP03 Automate managing data changes

Effective management of machine learning training data changes is
crucial for maintaining model reproducibility and providing
consistent performance over time. By implementing automated version
control for training data, you can precisely recreate a model
version when needed and maintain a clear audit trail of data
transformations.

**Desired outcome:** You establish
automated processes for tracking and managing changes to your
training data using version control technology. You gain the ability
to reproduce model versions exactly as they were originally created,
track data lineage through your ML pipeline, and maintain consistent
model performance across deployments. Your ML operations become more
reliable, transparent, and compatible with governance requirements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Manually tracking data versions in spreadsheets or
documentation.
- Storing multiple versions of datasets with inconsistent naming
conventions.
- Neglecting to record relationships between datasets and
resulting models.
- Not preserving feature engineering transformations applied to
training data.
- Relying on ad-hoc backup processes instead of systematic version
control.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Enables reproducible machine learning by maintaining exact data
version history.
- Improves troubleshooting by allowing precise recreation of model
versions.
- Enhances collaboration among data scientists through shared
version control.
- Provides audit trail for governance requirements.
- Reduces errors in model deployment by providing consistent
training data.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

Managing changes to training data is fundamental to maintaining
reproducible machine learning models. As your data evolves through
acquisition, cleaning, and feature engineering, implementing
automated version control allows you to track these changes
systematically. This provides confidence that you can recreate any
model version precisely when needed, which is essential for
troubleshooting, compliance alignment, and proviidng consistent
performance.

By implementing automated data versioning, you create a traceable
history of your training data that integrates seamlessly with your
ML pipeline. This approach mirrors software development best
practices by treating data as a critical asset requiring the same
level of version control as code. When data changes occur, whether
through new acquisitions or transformations, your versioning
system automatically captures these changes, making it possible to
track model lineage from training data to deployment.

### Implementation steps

- **Implement a data version control
system**. Begin by setting up a data version
control system that can handle ML datasets efficiently.
Tools like Git LFS, DVC (Data Version Control), or AWS
solutions can be used to track changes in your training
datasets. These tools provide mechanisms to capture dataset
metadata and references without storing the entire dataset
in the version control repository.
- **Establish a data management
strategy**. Define clear workflows for how data
should be versioned, including naming conventions, branching
strategies, and metadata requirements. Document how data
should flow through your ML pipeline and how versions will
be tracked at each stage.
- **Use AWS MLOps Framework**.
Implement the
[AWS MLOps Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/mlops/) to establish a standardized interface
for managing ML pipelines. This framework works with both
Amazon Machine Learning services and third-party services,
providing a comprehensive solution for ML operations. The
framework allows you to upload trained models (bring your
own model), configure pipeline orchestration, and monitor
operations—all while maintaining version control of data
assets.
- **Integrate with SageMaker AI Model
Registry**. Use
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry.html) to track model versions and
their associated artifacts. Model Registry maintains
comprehensive records of model lineage, including which
datasets were used for training and validation, preserving
the connection between models and their source data.
- **Establish CI/CD for ML
pipelines**. Set up continuous integration and
continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines specifically
designed for ML workflows using
[Amazon SageMaker AI Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/). This assists you to version and
test changes to both code and data properly before moving to
production.
- **Create reproducible training
environments**. Use container technology to package
your training environment along with references to specific
data versions.
[Amazon SageMaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) provides mechanisms to create reproducible
training jobs that can reference specific versions of your
datasets stored in
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
- **Implement data quality
monitoring**. Set up automated monitoring of data
quality metrics to detect drift or anomalies in incoming
data. Tools like
[Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) can identify when new data
differs from the baseline training data, allowing you to
make informed decisions about model retraining.
- **Configure automated
testing**. Implement automated tests that validate
data consistency and model performance when data versions
change. This verifies that new data meets quality standards
before being used in training or inference.
- **Document data versioning
procedures**. Create comprehensive documentation
that describes your data versioning strategy, including how
to retrieve specific versions of datasets and how to match
models with their corresponding training data versions.
