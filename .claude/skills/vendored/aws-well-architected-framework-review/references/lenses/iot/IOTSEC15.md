## IOTSEC15-BP01 Identify the set of relevant regulations for your IoT applications

Establish both the security and privacy related regulations
which apply to IoT applications. If the application processes
any information related to humans, then pay particular attention
to privacy regulations and the sets of people that will use the
application.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP01-01** *Understand which
standards and regulations apply to the IoT application.*

The following standards and regulations are a starting point to use to
understand which regulations apply to the application. There may
be industry-specific regulations which also apply:

- [ISA/IEC
62443](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards)
- [ISO/IEC
33601](https://www.iso.org/standard/80362.html)
- [ISO/SAE
21434](https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html)
- [Purdue
Model](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Infra_Topic_Paper_4-14_FINAL.pdf)
- [Industrial
Internet of Things Security Framework (IISF)](https://www.iiconsortium.org/iisf/)
- [NIST
Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- [NIST
800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)
- [General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
- [California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)
- [NERC-CIP](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/ReliabilityStandards.aspx)
- [Automotive
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC)](https://automotiveisac.com/)
- [National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/)

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP01-02** *Determine which
controls within the regulations apply to the IoT devices or
gateways and application components.*

Within each regulation, determine which controls apply to
the IoT application, the devices and gateways used in the
application, and other services that are made use of by the
application. Compliance with these controls can then be
evaluated.

## IOTSEC15-BP02 Set up logging and monitoring to support audit checks for compliance

Logging and monitoring provide a means of building a base of
evidence which can be used to show both explicit compliance with
regulations and, in the case of attempting to show that
something did not happen, showing that there are checks and
processing in place which would have identified an issue if that
issue have been present.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Low

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP02-01** *Centralize storage of log
records used for audit reporting.*

Use a centralized storage mechanism for log records to reduce
the potential for log records being lost or tampering with log
records by authorized or unauthorized users. By off-loading log
records to a separate storage location which has different
access controls, the potential for log record tampering can be
greatly reduced. Refer to recommendations for audit and logging
in the
[AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html)(AWS SRA) for examples of
centralizing log management and auditing activities.

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP02-02** *Identify which log
information can be used to show compliance with which
controls.*

For each control which can be checked based on log information
collected, identify the log records in the logged information
which provide positive evidence of compliance with the control.
For controls which require evidence that something did not
occur, use log records which show that if a situation did occur,
a log record would have signaled that situation. Use log testing
events and mock situations to test and verify that this is the
case.

## IOTSEC15-BP03 Implement automated compliance checking using compliance as code

With an understanding of which logged information provides
evidence of compliance with controls, automated compliance
checks can be implemented which use the log data and evaluate
the compliance check.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP03-01** *Use automated compliance
checking tools to evaluate compliance and produce summary
reports and dashboards.*

Use tools such as
[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and rules development kit (RDK),

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cloudwatch/),

[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/eventbridge/) Rules, and

[Serverless
Computing - AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/). to automate compliance checks.

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTSEC15-BP03-02** *Integrate compliance
checking with other problem management tools that are used by
the development and operations teams.*

Any work items or tasks which are generated from automated
compliance of IoT application logs should be reflected back into
the problem management tools used by the application and
infrastructure development teams. Depending on the tools used to
perform compliance checks, this integration can be built into
the environment by using services such as
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) coupled with

[Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sqs/) and

[Serverless
Computing - AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/).
