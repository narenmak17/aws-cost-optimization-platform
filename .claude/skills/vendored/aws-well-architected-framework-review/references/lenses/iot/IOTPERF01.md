## IOTPERF01-BP01 Optimize for device hardware resources utilization

When designing IoT solutions, it's crucial to consider the
limited hardware resources available on edge devices, such as
processing power, memory, and battery life. Optimizing resource
utilization can significantly improve performance, efficiency,
and overall device longevity. AWS offers several services and
tools to help architects and developers optimize their solutions
for device hardware constraints.

practice is not established:** High

*Apply efficient runtimes
and code language for embedded devices.*

When making architectural decisions, thoroughly evaluate the
hardware capabilities of the target devices, and select
appropriate AWS services and configurations to optimize resource
utilization. This approach can lead to improved performance,
extended battery life, and cost savings by reducing cloud
processing and data transfer requirements. Some key tools to
consider in your device components are:

- **AWS IoT Device Client
SDK**: Provides lightweight, optimized libraries
for various programming languages. These libraries enable
efficient communication with AWS IoT Core and other AWS
services, minimizing resource consumption on edge devices.
For optimal performance, select based on your device
constraints, prioritizing lower-level languages for
battery-powered or resource-limited deployments:

**Embedded C SDK**: Best
for highly constrained devices with minimal RAM
(256KB+). Offers lowest memory footprint and power
consumption.
- **C++ SDK**: Balances
performance with developer productivity for embedded
Linux applications and gateways.
- **Python, JavaScript, or Java
SDKs**: Choose only when device resources
permit, as they trade performance for ease of
development, in general.

- **FreeRTOS:** A real-time
operating system for microcontrollers that is designed to be
resource-efficient and highly configurable. It allows
developers to tailor the OS to specific hardware
requirements, reducing the overall footprint.
- For more complex scenarios, AWS IoT Greengrass is an open
source edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build,
deploy, and manage device software. It manages devices to
act locally on the data they generate, run predictions based
on machine learning models, filter and aggregate device
data, and only transmit necessary information to the cloud.
By processing data locally, AWS IoT Greengrass minimizes
network latency and optimizes resource utilization,
particularly for time-sensitive or bandwidth-constrained
applications.

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTPERF01-BP01-02** *Leverage edge gateways as hubs to bridge
communications with the cloud.*

Edge gateways act as intermediaries, aggregating data from
multiple devices, performing local processing and filtering, and
intelligently managing communication with the cloud. This
approach offloads workloads from the cloud and reduces network
traffic and latency. By implementing edge gateways with AWS IoT Greengrass, you can deploy AWS Lambda functions, machine
learning models, and other application components directly on
these gateways, enabling real-time processing and
decision-making at the edge. This architecture not only enhances
performance but also improves resilience by allowing continued
operation during intermittent cloud connectivity, maintaining
data integrity, and minimizing potential disruptions.
