# IOTREL14 — Reliability

**Pillar**: Reliability  
**Best Practices**: 3

## IOTREL14-BP01 Design server software to initiate communication only with devices that are online

Communication should be server initiated with devices that are
online rather than client-server requests. It enables you to
design client software to accept commands from the server.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

**Prescriptive guidance IOTREL14-
BP01-01** *Design client software to accept
commands from the server.*

- FreeRTOS provides pub/sub and shadow library to connected
devices.
- AWS IoT Core provides device shadow capability to persist
device states.
- AWS IoT Device Registry contains a list of devices connected
to AWS IoT Core. AWS IoT Device Registry lets you manage
devices by grouping them.

## IOTREL14-BP02 Implement multi-Region support for IoT applications and devices

Cloud service providers have the same service in multiple
Regions. You can use this architecture to divert device data to
a Regional endpoint that is in not down. Data consumers should
be enabled in all Regions that consume the diverted device data.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Low

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTREL14-BP02-01** *Architect device software
to reach multiple Regions in case one is not
available.*

- AWS IoT is available in multiple Regions with different
endpoints. If an endpoint is not available, divert device
traffic to a different endpoint.
- AWS IoT configurable endpoints can be used with Amazon Route 53 to divert IoT traffic to a new Regional endpoint.
- AWS IoT Configurable Endpoints:
[Domain
configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-configurable.html)

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTREL14-BP02-02** *Enable device
authentication certificates in multiple Regions.*

- AWS IoT provides devices with authentication certificates to
verify on connection. Deploy the device certificates in the
Regions where the device will connect.
- Setup the cloud side IoT data consumers to accept and
process data in multiple Regions.
- AWS IoT device registration:
[Simplify
IoT device registration and easily move devices between AWS accounts with AWS IoT Core Multi-Account
Registration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/simplify-multi-account-device-provisioning-and-certificate-authority-registration-using-aws-iot-core/).

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTREL14-BP02-03** *Use device services in all
Regions the device connects to.*

- AWS IoT Rules Engine diverts device data to use multiple
services. Set up AWS IoT Rules Engine in the respective
Regions to divert traffic to the appropriate services.

for AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html)

## IOTREL14-BP03 Use edge devices to store and analyze data

Edge storage can provide additional storage for device data.
Data can be stored at the edge during large-scale network events
and streamed later, when network is available.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTREL14-BP03-01** *Use an edge device as a
connection point to store and analyze data.*

- AWS IoT Greengrass can be used for local processing for
serverless functions, containers, messaging, storage, and
machine learning inference.
- Data can be stored in AWS IoT Greengrass and sent to the
network when it's available.
- [AWS IoT Greengrass features](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/features/) and components such a Stream
Manager can be used to help design resilient solutions at
the edge.
