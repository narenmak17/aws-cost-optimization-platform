## IOTPERF02-BP01 Implement comprehensive monitoring solutions to collect performance data from your IoT devices

It is important to establish performance baselines and key
performance indicators (KPIs) specific to your IoT devices and
application requirements. These metrics may include device CPU
and memory utilization, network bandwidth consumption, battery
life, and embedded software-level metrics such as data
throughput and latency. Additionally, depending on the
programming language used, other memory metrics to consider are
heap usage or garbage collection frequency (Java), memory leak
detection and dynamic memory allocation ratio (C/C++), and
memory pool utilization (Python).

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** Medium

**Prescriptive guidance
IOTPERF02-BP01-01** *Analyze device metrics and compare to a
standard baseline.*

Collecting historical performance data from your devices helps
you understand regular behavior for your deployments and
potentially detect anomalies by using machine learning
strategies and tools. Use AWS IoT Device Defender to audit
device configurations, monitor device metrics, and detect
deviations from expected behavior. Additionally, services like
Amazon CloudWatch can be integrated to collect and analyze
device performance metrics, set alarms, and run automated
actions based on predefined thresholds.

## IOTPERF02-BP02 Evaluate the runtime performance of your application

Application performance in production can be different from what
you observe in a controlled test environment. Actively analyzing
the performance of your application based on device health,
network latency, and payload size provides insight on how to
obtain performance improvements. By using different types of
metrics, the health of each device in a multi-device setting can
be obtained.

**Level of risk exposed if this best
practice is not established:** High

**Prescriptive guidance IOTPERF02-BP02-1** *Analyze connection patterns, sensor data
and set up a device security profile to detect
anomalies.*

- Measuring changes in connection patterns of devices might
indicate some devices having a jittery network connection.
- Comparing device-side timestamps from multiple devices to
arrival times on the cloud-side might indicate local network
latency or additional hops in device path.
