## HPCSEC01-BP01 Separate HPC cluster components in different network layers

When architecting for
[SEC05-BP01](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html),
you create network layers and separate components into different
layers. In HPC clusters, you can separate different cluster
components, such as head node, login nodes, and compute
resources. For example, with AWS ParallelCluster, the cluster
head node can be separated from the compute resources. The head
node could be running in a public subnet with the compute fleet
running in a private subnet. Additionally, you could further
isolate your cluster by running in private subnets with private
connectivity to the cluster.

## HPCSEC01-BP02 Control traffic flow within your HPC cluster

According to
[SEC05-BP02](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_layered.html),
you control traffic flow within your network layers. You permit
only the network flows necessary for the components of your
workloads to communicate. When running tightly coupled HPC
workloads with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), EFA requires being
a member of a security group allowing all inbound and outbound
traffic to and from itself. Each cluster member will allow all
traffic between members when processing the same EFA-based job.

Clusters are commonly used with multiple running jobs and a
single security group would be used for all EFA traffic without
separation by job. If your environment requires further security
separation by job, consider an alternative design, such as
multiple clusters or a more advanced security group mapping,
rather than having one security group for all traffic between
members.
